CSigerStop - Poster Generator
=============================

Evening project using

- Python 3
- [Falcon](http://falcon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- [Wand](http://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.4.0/)
- [gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/)
- [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/)


Mostly built out of boredom.
Wanted to play with a new Release of Falcon, and mix in some
image handling.

Approximately 5 hour job + a few extra hours polishing up.

Might serve as reference for similar projects.
Direct copy to production def. not recommended :)



Deployed using [Dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku).
Should also work out of the box on heroku.

Used [Honcho](https://honcho.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) as my
Procfile runner for development.
